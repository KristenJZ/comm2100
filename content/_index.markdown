Hi, Welcome to COMM2100 - the SI Session on Monday and Thursday with Kristen (Jing) Zhang. My name is Kristen (Jing) Zhang. I am your GTA for COMM 2100 this academic year (2023 fall and 2024 spring). This website was built to share with you the information about the SI sessions. You can use it to get access to the slides on sessions. During the sessions, I encourage you to express your opinions on every question and discuss with your peers.

SI Session(2023 Fall): Mondays, 11 AM - 12 PM, CHHS 161; Thursdays, 3 - 4 PM, CHHS 380.

**SI session (2024 Spring): Mondays, 11 AM - 12 PM, CHHS 380; Thursdays, 3 - 4PM, DENNY 220.**
