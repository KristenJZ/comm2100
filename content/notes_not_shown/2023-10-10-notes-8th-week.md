## Rhetoric

In the tradition of rhetoric.

Also, it's half objective and half interpretive.

It's about arts, and also about persuasion.

Theorist: Aristotle.

#### 1. Rhetoric: discovering all possible means of persuasion. 

Three different categories: 

Forensic: emphasizes that people make decisions about past actions. For example, the scenario of a court is a place for forensics.

Epideictic: offer to pray/blame, to benefit a president day's audience/situation.

Deliberative: political speaking. Generally, a deliberative speech is designed to influence votes, for a future policy/person in power.

#### 2. Social Proofs from internal (artistic) to external (inartistic)

Internal proofs: what we can control in the speech

Audience is external proof, which we cannot control.

1）heart (pathos)

the emotional proof, which comes from the feelings the speech draws out of those who hear it.

2）head (logos)

the logical proof, which comes from the line of argument in a speech.

A classic logos: enthymeme (a type of reasoning that leaves out an accepted premise)

- Deductive thinking: from premise (major-minor) to conclusion.

Another form of logos: example. 

3）credibility (ethos)

the perceived credibility as it is revealed through the message.

Three components to credibility:

- perceived intelligence.
- virtuous character.
- goodwill.

#### 3. Five Canons of rhetoric used for measuring the quality of a speaker

- Invention: adjust when necessary.
- Arrangement: the organization of the speech. Should be simple, direct, and highly relevant to your topic.
- Style: how the speaker presents the speech. The metaphor is a powerful mechanism we can use to deliver speech.
- Delivery: be natural.
- Memory: memorize, but not plan. Also calling back to those things to stock the audiences' memory.

#### 4. Critiques

- Violations of the standard of relative simplicity.
- Original presentation of ideas backs aesthetic appeal.
