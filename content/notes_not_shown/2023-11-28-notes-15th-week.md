## Cultivation Theory

**A quite objective theory in the socio-psycological tradition and socio-cultural tradition.**

Theorist: George Gerbner

Key question: how media use affects the real world. How media makes people think about a very violent world. (especially heavy TV viewers)

Also, Gerbner viewed TV as a story teller.

#### 1. TV has changed in three ways since this theory was originally constructed.

- Abundance of choices
- One thing not change, is that many TV still emphasize on violence.

#### 2. Prong 1: What's on TV - Message system analysis

A careful study of TV content. What does content say?

Method: content analysis

many content: dramatic violence's over-expression (like physical harm) is the focal content. 

#### 3. Prong 2: How much does TV influence us? Cultivation analysis

those who spend more time watching TV are more likely to see the "real world" through TV's lens.

heavy viewers: 4 hours every day.

When people make judgement of the world, they refer to the small information that comes to their mind quickly.

- mainstreaming: when heavy TV viewers from disparate groups develop a common outlook.
- resonance: when viewers' real-life environment is like the world of TV.

Two results:

- cultivation differential: difference in the percentage giving the "television answer" between heavy and light viewers.
- mean world syndrome: cynical mindset of general mistrust of others.

#### 4. Prong 3: Who makes TV this way and why? - Institutional process analysis

behind the scenes of media organizations to understand their policies and practices.

#### 5. Critiques

- Some scholars criticize the methodology.
- Critics do not believe Gerbner's claims of causality.

## Agenda Setting

**A highly objective theory in the socio-psychological tradition.**

Theorists: Max McCombs + Donald Shaw

focus on news media (print, broadcast)

hypothesis: over time, the media agenda shapes the public agenda.

#### 1. Level 1: The media tell us what to think about.

#### 2. Level 2: The media tell us which attributes of issues are most important (framing)

they can downplay/highlight something.

#### 3. Level 3: The media tell us which issues go together.

Networked agenda setting.

see the connections they are trying to make.

#### 4. Media can shape behavior

e.g., vote; vaccination.

#### 5. Who sets the agenda: interest aggregation

People who demand center stage for their one overriding concern.

Agenda melding: melding agenda from various sources to create pictures of the world that fits our preferences.

- vertical media: broad audiences.
- horizontal media: niche audiences.
