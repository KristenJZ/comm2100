## Tuesday, Dramatism

**A theory leaning to interpretive, in the tradition of rhetoric.**

Rhetorical tradition: Communication as social address.

Key question: Why did people choose the words that they chose? To determine the motivation behind their message.

Could be considered as a theory, but also could be considered as a method.

Theorist: Kenneth Burke

#### 1. Dramatism is a technique of analysis of language and thought as modes of action rather than as means of conveying information.

Intentional action + symbolic action = drama

Plan + action = drama

Symbolic action is giving life to the motive behind the message.

#### 2. Feature 1: Language is the genesis of guilt.

Language can lead to the downfall of ourselves – the negative part of ourselves.

It matters because language brings out the negative sides of people – People are inherently good and positive.

“Man is the symbol-using inventor of the negative separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of the hierarchy, and rotten with perfection.”

- "Rotten with perfection" means that it's never possible to get to the perfection in the redemption of guilt in language.

#### 3. Feature 2: the guilt-redemption cycle describes getting rid of guilt through purification

motive could be redeeming themselves from guilt.

Guilt -》purification -》redemption

1）God term vs. devil term

God terms: summing up good.

Devil term: bad and wrong.

It's a contrast between good and evil. 

2）Purification: two ways

- Mortification: Taking personal responsibility

- Victimage: Blaming someone outside

#### 3. Identification is the common ground between the speaker and the audience

#### 4. The dramatistic pentad is a tool critics can use to discern the motives of a speaker or writer by labeling five key elements of the human drama

- Act: What is being done?
- Agency: Mean by which an action occurs.
- Agent: Person doing the act.
- Scene: Setting/Background for action.
- Purpose: Reason/Rationale behind the action.

## 2. Tuesday, Narrative Paradigm

**A theory leaning to interpretive, in the tradition of rhetoric.**

All communication other than common words, are considered stories.

Theorist: Walther

Narration: involves symbolic actions that have sequence and meaning for those who live, create, or interpret them.

#### 1. Paradigm: a universal model that calls for people to view events through a common interpretive lens

Paradigm shifts from the rational world to the narrative.

Rational-world paradigm: a scientific or philosophical approach to knowledge that assumes people are logical.

#### 2. Narrative rationality: a way to evaluate the worth of stories.

Narrative coherence: the story sounds probable.

Narrative fidelity: the story is true and humane.

#### 3. Ideal audience: actual community existing over time that believes in the same value
