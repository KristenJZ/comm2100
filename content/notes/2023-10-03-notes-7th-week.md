## 1st Class, Exam 1

## 2nd Class, Thursday, Elaboration Likelihood Model

**A highly objective theory in the tradition of socio-psychological** (almost the most objective one)

Theorists: Richard Petty & John Cacioppo

Key question: How do you get someone to listen to you when you are making an argument?

#### 1. There are two routes to persuasion: the central route and the peripheral route

Central: high mental effort

Peripheral route: low mental effort

The mental effort is what the listener gives to the speaker

1）The central route is based on elaboration

Elaboration: "the extent to which a person carefully thinks about issue-relevant arguments contained in a persuasive communication." (p. 152)

#### 2. Elaboration likelihood is based on motivation, ability, and type

1）Motivation: personal relevance + need for cognition

Personal relevance: the topic is relevant to me.

Need for cognition: You have strong need for cognition on a daily basis.

2）Ability: Free from distraction + Sufficient knowledge

3）Type

Objective + Bias

Based on the speech quality and your initial attitude

- Objective elaboration: bottom-up thinking.

- Bias elaboration: top-down thinking. You bias attitude is covering from top to bottom, covering everything the speaker is going to say.

#### 3. Peripheral Route

Most of the time we make quick judgements, using the peripheral routes.

Cues for us to use the peripheral route. e.g., they dress well; they look professional; etc.

However, the attitude change is weak/no attitude change.

If you use peripheral route, you might experience attitude change several times.

- Reciprocation. "You own me."
- Consistency. "We always use it."
- Social proof. "Everybody is doing it."
- Liking. You are persuaded by the person, not the message.
- Authority. Someone in the authority role, and they are guiding you in the correct direction.
- Scarcity. Pressure convince us to buy something. If we don't do it now, we will never do it again.

The cues might overlap and happen simultaneously. 

#### 4. Critique

difficule to test.
