## Symbolic Interactionism Theory

**A highly interpretive theory in the socio-cultural tradition.** - people produce and reproduce culture in communication.

Theorist: George Herbert Mead

（He didn't write the book. His students recorded his minds in the book *Mind, Self and Society*

#### 1. Principles

1）Principle #1: Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meaning they assign to them. 

stimulus -> interpretation -> response

- When we do verbal/non-verbal communication, we have guessings about what will be the response.
- Human reactions towards stimuli are based on the meaning assigned to them. 
- Interpretation counts: A fact is a fact, but what it means to us is different.  Acting based on the interpretation.
- *e.g., I hear people cry, and I assign meaning to that, and I assume that they are sad. I give him/her a hug.* 

2）Principle #2: Meaning arises out of the social interaction that people have with each other.

The object is meaningless until we assign meaning.

**naming: the central aspect of the principle**: As humans, we have the ability to name things. The ability sets humans apart from animals.

- The more names you know, the more knowledge you will know.
- We all have assumptions about these names.
- Society determines the meaning.

3）Principle #3: An individual's interpretation of symbols is modified by their own thought process. (**minding process**)

**Minding: The moment of reflective pause.** We take a moment a think through what we are experiencing.

#### 2. Looking glass self

Looking glass self: We learn who we are (the self) through our socially constructed ideas about how others see us.

**We know who we are through interaction and introspection.**

- What others believe about us.
  - For, If you say lots of negative things about children, they will see themselves in that way.
- Understanding ourselves based on our interaction with others.
- The "self" concept will always change because of the different interactions with others.
- **"I" vs "me":**
  - I: subjective, unpredictable, and even chaotic parts of ourselves.
  - me: Objective, the thing you understand about yourself. 
  - **The moment you become aware of yourself, it moves from I to me.**
    - The real you: I.
    - The reflection: me. 

#### 3. Society - the generalized other

The generalized other: the composite mental image of others in an overall community, their expectations, and possible responses. 

- That's why trends become trends.
- The more people in your generalized other, the harder to keep to society's expectations.
- The more people around you, the more you become aware of yourself.

#### 4. Applications

1）Application for #1: The generalized other teaches us who "me" is in both positive and negative ways.

2）Application for #2: self-fulfillling pophecy - the tendency for our expectations to evoke responses that confirm what we anticipated.

our actions -> others belief -> others actions -> our beliefs

#### 5. Critiques

- does not calll for societal reform.
- lacks aeshetic appeal: no organized design - not very simplistic.
- Mead overstates his case.



## Expectancy Violations Theory

**A highly objective theory in interpersonal communication, in socio-psychological tradition**

Theorist: Judee Burgoon

She's interested in non-verbal communication and personal space.

#### 1. Personal space: the invisible, variable volume of space surrounding an individual that defines their preferred distance from others.

most people will be put in the social space (1.2m - 3.7m)

#### 2. Core concept

1）Expectancy: what is predicted to occur rather than what is desired.

It depends on what is expected.

- context: rely on cultural norms.
  - Where is the interaction taking place and playing a role in the way you hope the interaction to  go?
- relationship factors: 
  - similarity, familarity, and like
- communicator charatertistics: demographic factors, personal features, and how they communicate.

2）Violation valence: the positive/negative value we place on an expected behavior.

3）Communication reward valence: the sum of positive and negative attributes that the person has plu their potential to reward or punish.

#### 3. Critique

- Does not account reciprocity.
- Is comm. valence or behavior valence more important?
