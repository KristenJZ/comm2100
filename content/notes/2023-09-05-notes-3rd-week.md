## 1st Class, Tuesday, Symbolic Interactionism Theory

**A highly interpretive theory in the socio-cultural tradition.**

Theorist: George Herbert Mead

（He didn't write the book. His students recorded his minds in the book *Mind, Self and Society*

#### 1. Principles

1）Principle #1: Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meaning they assign to them. 

stimulus -> interpretation -> response

- When we do verbal/non-verbal communication, we have guessings about what will be the response.
- Human reactions towards stimuli are based on the meaning assigned to them. 
- Interpretation counts: A fact is a fact, but what it means to us is different.  Acting based on the interpretation.
- *e.g., I hear people cry, and I assign meaning to that, and I assume that they are sad. I give him/her a hug.* 

2）Principle #2: Meaning arises out of the social interaction that people have with each other.

The object is meaningless until we assign meaning.

**naming: the central aspect of the principle**: As humans, we have the ability to name things. The ability sets humans apart from animals.

- The more names you know, the more knowledge you will know.
- We all have assumptions about these names.
- Society determines the meaning.

3）Principle #3: An individual's interpretation of symbols is modified by their own thought process. (**minding process**)

**Minding: The moment of reflective pause.** We take a moment a think through what we are experiencing.

#### 2. Looking glass self

Looking glass self: We learn who we are (the self) through our socially constructed ideas about how others see us.

**We know who we are through interaction and introspection.**

- What others believe about us.
  - For, If you say lots of negative things about children, they will see themselves in that way.
- Understanding ourselves based on our interaction with others.
- The "self" concept will always change because of the different interactions with others.
- **"I" vs "me":**
  - I: subjective, unpredictable, and even chaotic parts of ourselves.
  - me: objective, the thing you understand about yourself.

#### 3. Society
