## 1st Class, Tuesday, Cognitive Dissonance Theory

**A highly objective theory in the tradition of socio-psychological**

In the section on social influence/persuasion

Theorist: Leon Festinger

Interested in the dissonance between what people know and what people do. 

Assumption: People will do everything to reduce dissonance, for the reason of safety.

**Cognitive Dissonance: A distressing mental state caused by inconsistency between a person and the person's beliefs, or a belief and an action.**

We have a human need to avoid this distress. Therefore, we accept one or reject the other (whichever is easier).

e.g., the sour grape – if the fox cannot have the grape on the tree, he will believe that it's sour. It's unable to change the action (to get the grape), so he changes his belief.

#### 1. Mental Mechanisms to ensure their actions & attitudes are in harmony

1）Selective exposure prevents dissonance.

We avoid any information that may go against the action.

2）Post-decision dissonance creates a need for reassurance

This usually happens when people make a close-minded decision.

e.g., People read the reviews after they purchase some items. The more life-changing decisions there will be, the more dissonance there will be, so there will be more need for seeking reassurance.

3）Minimal justification for action induces attitude change

Minimal Justification: Minimal incentive will provide longer change.

Minimal justification: too much justification won't have a long-standing attitude change. Just enough to change the attitude. When you offer someone too much justification, they will be sensitive, but not change their attitudes.

Experiment: Would I lie for a dollar?

#### 2. Major revisions to CDT

- Self-consistency: Our actions should be consistent with who we believe we are. If you want to persuade others not to smoke, you'd choose to tell them that smoking is not their style.
- Personal responsibility for bad outcomes: People experience dissonance when their actions have unnecessarily hurt someone. People are afraid that their behaviors will affect their children, and they will change their behavior.
- Self-affirmation
