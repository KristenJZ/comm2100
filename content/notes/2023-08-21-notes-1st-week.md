## Communication and Theory - the Concept

### 1. Communication is the relational process of creating and interpreting messages that elicit a response

- message: a stimulus that a source sends to a receiver
- creation of message: The communicator makes a conscious choice of message form and substance
- interpretation of message: "people mean things"
- a relational process: the communication happen between people, and changes the connection among people
- messages that elicit a response: "You cannot not communicate."

### 2. Theoryï¼ša set of systematic, informed hunches about the way things work

- keywords: multiple, informed, and systematic
- metaphor & the role of theory
  - net,camera, map [but not catch, record, or draw everything]
  - explain: to learn current and past experiences
  - organize & predict: to make future experiences easier
  - clarification: to improve our relationships, workplaces, and social institutions

### 3. Two approaches to theory

Objective: assume that truth is singular and accessible through unbiased observation

Interpretive: assume meaning or value to communicative texts, emphasizing the power of language

**It depends on the epistemology**: the study of the origin, nature, method, and limits of knowledge. 

- *How likely the scholars are going to approach to the reality?*

- *in a unbiased way or in an intepretive way?*
- *It depends on person, perspective, and context.*
