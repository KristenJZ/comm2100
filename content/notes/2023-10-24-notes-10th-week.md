## Symbolic Convergence Theory

**In the middle of objective and interpretive, and in the tradition of rhetoric and socio-psychological**

Theorist: Emest Bormann

Interested in how communication brings people together, within groups.

#### 1. Sharing group fantasies creates symbolic convergence

Fantasy: dramatizing messages, that is enthusiatically embraced by the group.

They become shared interpretations of an event, and these interpretations would fill a group's needs.

#### 2. Dramatizing message: imaginative language by a group member describing past, future, or outside events.

Dramatizing message -> fantasy chain

Fantasy chain: a symbolic explosion of lively agreement within a group in response to a member’s dramatizing message

#### 3. Fantasy theme: the content of the fantasy that has chained out within a group

- meanings
- emotions
- motives
- actions

#### 4. Symbolic Cue: Fantasy theme will be triggered by symbolic cues

Symbolic cue: an agreed upon trigger that sets off group members to respond as they did when they first shared the fantasy.

#### 5. Fantasy type: a cluster of related fantasy themes

[the multiple fantasy themes fit into a kind of fantasy type]

#### 6. Symbolic Convergence: when two or more private symbol worlds incline toward each other.

**Not all convergence leads to cohesion. Only in most cases**.

Dramatizing message -> shared fantasy -> fantasy chain -> fantasy them (meaning, emotions, motives, actions) -> symbolic convergence -> group cohesion

- meanwhile, symbolic cue -> what we need to have shared fantasy
- fantasy type: when we put all similar fantasy themes together.

#### 7. Fantasy theme analysis - rhetorical vision

Fantasy theme analysis: when symbolic convergence no longer in small group, but in larger groups/ rhetorcal communities.

- characters.
- plot lines.
- scene
- sanctioning agent



## Cultural Approaches to Organizations

#### 1. Methodology: Ethnography

- Who people in a culture think they are, what they think they are doing, and to what and they think they are doing it.
- Highly interpretive
- It starts from observation, and the object is to create thick description – cover thoughts, emotions, intentions, motives

#### 2. Three forms of communication

which provided helpful access to the unique shared meanings within an organization

- metaphor
- stories
  - Corporate story
  - Personal story
  - Collegial story
- rituals

#### 3. Critism

- Does not inform change
- Does not challenge the status quo.
- Based on interpretation, may not be trustful.
