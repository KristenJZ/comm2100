## 1st Class, Tuesday, Communication Management Privacy 

**An interpretive theory in the tradition of socio-cultural**

Theorist: Sandra Petronio

She cares about privacy in interpersonal communication, rather than self-disclosure.

#### 1. Principle 1: People believe that we have privacy and we are obliged to care for that information.

We set boundaries about our own privacy.

For example, in health, we need to close this information, which will impact our life, and we set the boundary, because of the liability.

#### 2. Principle 2: People control their private information through the use of personal privacy rules.

So we understand others' privacy through their rules.

The rules could be influenced by:

- culture
- gender: e.g., women were supposed to share more information than men.
- motivation
- context: context is more influential. Because when you talk to someone, that determines whether or not to talk about privacy.
- risk/benefit ratio

#### 3. Principle 3: When others are told or discover a person's private information, they become co-owners of that information

#### 4. Principle 4: Co-owners of private information need to negotiate mutually agreeable privacy rules

Boundary ownership - the right and responsibilities that co-owners of private information have to control the spread of that information.

Boundary linkage - the process in which a confidant is linked to the privacy boundary of the person who revealed the information

Boundary permeability - how fluid the boundaries around the private information area

#### 5. Principle 5: When co-owners of private information don't effectively negotiate and follow jointly held privacy rules, boundary turbulence is the likely result

Boundary turbulence: The disruption in the way the co-owners share private information.

The forms:

- Fuzzy boundaries.
- Intentional breaches.
- Mistakes

#### 6. Critiques

- Lacks aesthetic appeal
- How boundaries are created - no explanation
