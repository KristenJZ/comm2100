## Tuesday, Cultural Approaches to Organizations + CCO

#### 1. Methodology: Ethnography

- Who people in a culture think they are, what they think they are doing, and to what and they think they are doing it.
- Highly interpretive
- It starts from observation, and the object is to create thick description – cover thoughts, emotions, intentions, motives

#### Three forms of communication

which provided helpful access to the unique shared meanings within an organization

- metaphor
- stories
  - Corporate story
  - Personal story
  - Collegial story
- rituals

#### Critism

- Does not inform change
- Does not challenge the status quo.
- Based on interpretation, may not be trustful.

#### 2. Communicative Constitution of Organization

In socio-cultural tradition, relatively interpretive.

Basic Idea: Communication constitutes/creates organization.

1）Constitution: Communication calls organizations into being

Sensemaking: Communication behaviors can reduce ambiguity.

2）Four flows of communication

- Membership negotiation: communication that regulates the extent to which a person is an organization member.
- Self-structuring: communication that shapes the relationships among an organization's members – who is who
- Activity coordination: communication that accomplishes the organization's work toward goals – how we get things done
- Institutional positioning: communication between an organization and external entities

3）Four principles of the flows

- All flows are necessary for organizations
- Different flows happen in different places
- The same message can address multiple flows
- Different flows address different audiences

4）Critiques

- Top-down approaches
- Flows are not sufficient conditions for producing an organization.
