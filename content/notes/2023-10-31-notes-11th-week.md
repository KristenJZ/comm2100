## Communicative Constitution of Organization

**In socio-cultural tradition, relatively interpretive.**

Theorist: Robert McPhee

Basic Idea: Communication constitutes/creates organization.

1）Constitution: Communication calls organizations into being

Sensemaking: Communication behaviors can reduce ambiguity.

2）Four flows of communication

- Membership negotiation: communication that regulates the extent to which a person is an organization member. [socialization - you are socializing into your role, and learning the land]
- Self-structuring: communication that shapes the relationships among an organization's members – who is who
- Activity coordination: communication that accomplishes the organization's work toward goals – how we get things done
- Institutional positioning: communication between an organization and external entities

3）Four principles of the flows

- All flows are necessary for organizations
- Different flows happen in different places
- The same message can address multiple flows
- Different flows address different audiences

4）Critiques

- Top-down approaches
- Flows are not sufficient conditions for producing an organization.
