## Semiotics

**A quite interpretive theory in the semiotic tradition**

Theorist: Roland Barthes

#### 1. Semiotics: the analysis of anything that can stand for something else

sign = signifier & signified

signifier: the physical form or the thing we see.

signified: the thing we can visualize based on the signifier (the meaning)

#### 2. Two sign systems

- Denotative sign system: a descriptive sign without ideological content
- Connotative sign system: a sign that has lost its historical referent
  - Therefore, it's about power status quo. People with more power will make the semiotics look natural, and conceal the power status.


#### 3. Why semiotics in mass communication

Most semiotics signs, when then come into mass comm, they become buzzwords/memes, and then become part of the social culture.

Media technology can spread it quickly. 

#### 4. Critique

- Semiotics has not generated a large community of agreement.

## Uses and Gratifications

**A quite objective theory in the socio-psychological tradition.**

Theorist: Elihu Katz

We use media for different reasons.

#### 1. Assumption 1: People deliberately use media for particular purposes

it's about channels.

uniform effects model: It assumed that people are all effeced in the same way.

#### 2. Assumption 2: People seek to gratify needs through media use.

#### 3. Assumption 3: Media compete for our time and attention

#### 4. Assumption 4: Media affect different people differently

#### 5. Assumption 5: People can accurately report their media use and motivation

Classic eight motivations (developed on TV media)

- Killing/passing time.
- Social interaction.
- Companionship.
- Relaxation.
- Escape.
- Information.
- Enjoyment.
- Excitement.

#### 6. Parasocial relationship: a sense of friendship or emotional attachment that develope between TV viewers and media personalities

#### 7. Critiques

- The theory stops at description.
- The theory may not be testable.
