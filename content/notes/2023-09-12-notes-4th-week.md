## 1st Class, Tuesday, Social Penetration Theory

**A highly objective theory in the socio-psychological tradition.**

Theorist: Irwin Altman & Dalmas Taylor

#### 1. Metaphor: Onion - everyone has their comfort level of sharing themselves

1）Closeness develops if individuals proceed in a gradual, orderly fashion from superficial to intimate.

2）Outer layer: how we present ourselves in public space

core: who we are at the core of ourselves

3）self-disclosure has both depth and breadth

breadth: how far we are willing to share (differnt topics)

depth: the degree of intimacy is going below (superficial-intimate-personal-core)

- Observations about depth:
  - Peripheral items are exchanged more often and sooner.
  - Self-disclosure is reciprocal, especially early on.
  - Social pen is rapid at the beginning but slows down once the inner layers of the onion are reached.
  - Depenetration is a gradual process of layer-by-layer withdrawal.

#### 2. The result

outcome (people regulate their closeness) = rewards - costs

- Comparison level: the threshold above which an outcome appears attractive
- Compasison level of alternatives: evaluating other relationships' options at this moment

#### 3. Critiques

- disclosure does not always mean closeness.
  - like sometimes to manipulate others.
- Social exchange assumptions.
- Social media and disclosure.
  - We can learn a person on social media, but do not know them. Just keep it to yourself.
- Do people always act in their own interest?
  - This theory encourages selfishness, but in friendship, we can sacrifice.
