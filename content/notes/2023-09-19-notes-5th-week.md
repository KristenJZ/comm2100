## 1st Class, Tuesday, Social Information Processing Theory

**A highly objective theory in the socio-psychological tradition.**

Theorist: Joseph Walther

Core question: Is it possible to build strong interpersonal relationship only online (without nonverbal cues)? - CMC [Computer Mediated Communication]

CMC: More than computer. 

#### 1. Assumption

Assumption: Relationships grow only to the extent that people can gain information about each other.

Social Information —> Impression Formation —> Relationship Development

- Previous studies about CMC used a cues-filtered-out approach
  - Communication is impersonal or task-oriented
  - F2F communication is richest due to verbal and nonverbal cue access
  - Unclear social context cues leads to flaming or toxicity

#### 2. Feature of CMC

- Verbal cues can replace nonverbal cues is a key feature of CMC that allows us to convey the same meaning.
- Extended time: allows us to exchange social information on our own time.
  - We can be more personal, and we can pause the time.

#### 3. Hyper-personal Perspective: CMC relationships may be more intimate than those developed face-to-face

- sender: selective self-presentation.
- receiver: over-attribution of similarity - we tend to think that we are similar.
- channel: allows people to communication asynchronically
- feedback: Self-fulfilling prophecy – Both parties from positive relationships with each other are likely to play into the impressions, making it come true, in order to achieve a positive outcome.

#### 4. Warranting value: a reason to believe that the information is true

low warrant information: the information that can be manipulated easily

#### 5. Critique

- SIP doesn't consider modality weaving: We have many types of CMC.
- SIP lacks explanatory mechanism beyond the lab.
