## Social Information Processing Theory

**A highly objective theory in the socio-psychological tradition.**

Theorist: Joseph Walther

Core question: Is it possible to build strong interpersonal relationship only online (without nonverbal cues)? - CMC [Computer Mediated Communication]

CMC: More than computer. 

#### 1. Assumption

Assumption: Relationships grow only to the extent that people can gain information about each other.

Social Information —> Impression Formation —> Relationship Development

- Previous studies about CMC used a **cues-filtered-out** approach
  - Communication is impersonal or task-oriented
  - F2F communication is richest due to verbal and nonverbal cue access
  - Unclear social context cues leads to flaming or toxicity

#### 2. Feature of CMC

- Verbal cues can replace nonverbal cues is a key feature of CMC that allows us to convey the same meaning.
- Extended time: allows us to exchange social information on our own time.
  - We can be more personal, and we can pause the time.
  - People can develop their relationship through CMC if they can anticipate that they will have the opportunity of talking with others in the future.

#### 3. Hyper-personal Perspective: CMC relationships may be more intimate than those developed face-to-face

- sender: selective self-presentation.
- receiver: over-attribution of similarity - we tend to think that we are similar.
- channel: allows people to communication asynchronically
- feedback: Self-fulfilling prophecy – Both parties from positive relationships with each other are likely to play into the impressions, making it come true, in order to achieve a positive outcome.

#### 4. Warranting value: a reason to believe that the information is true

low warrant information: the information that can be manipulated easily

#### 5. Critique

- SIP doesn't consider modality weaving: We have many types of CMC.
- SIP lacks explanatory mechanism beyond the lab.





## Relational Dialectics Theory

A highly interpretive theory in the tradition of socio-cultural.

Theorists: Leslie Baxter & Mikhail Bakhtin

#### 1. Relational dialectics

Concept: the dynamics and unceasing struggle between discourses about interpersonal relationships.

Discourses can make up our relationships, and discourses can compete with each other.

constitutive dialogue: communication that creates, sustains, and alters relationship and the social world.

#### 2. Main dialectics to affect relationships

Integration <—> Separation

Stability <—> Change

Expression <—> Non-expression

e.g., traditional vs. modern; secretcy vs. transparency.

#### 3. Internal dialectics vs. External dialectics

External: competing the dialectics between the couple and their communities

Internal: competing the dialectics between the couple themselves

1）Internal dialectics

Connection — Autonomy

Certainty — Uncertainty

Openness — Closedness

2）External dialectics

Inclusion — Seclusion

Conventionality — Uniqueness

Revolution — Concealment

#### 4. seperation & Interplay

Seperation: when we voice different discourses at different times

Interplay: when we voice different discourses at the same time

#### 5. Critique

- RDT studies rely on self-report
- Lacks aesthetic appeal:
