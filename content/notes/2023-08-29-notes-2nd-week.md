## 1st Class, Tuesday

### Review: the scale from objective to interpretive

Interpretive scholars: put all the experiences (from them/the participants) to create meaning and multiple realities

Objective scholars: put the theory out of the maths/models

### Different standards

#### 1. Objective theories: scientific standards

1) prediction of future events: Will people repeat the same behaviors? 

   Sometimes human behaviors cannot be predictable. But most of the times, it will predict very well.

   *How to define the prediction: the confidence interval in quantitative research - 95%*

2) Explanation of the data

   To be able to predict, you need to be able to explain the data.

3) Relative simplicity

   occam's razor: two ways, you choose the simpler one.

   **It's simple, but it can involve complex understandings.**

4) Hypotheses that can be tested

   Scientific theories should be able to proved wrong. ï¼ˆonly a possibility of being true)

5) practical utility

   The theories will be used in different contexts.

6) quantitative research: care for statistics and data - A causes B

   e.g., survey (the collection of self-reported data); experiment 

   

   **The standards cannot be met all the time: theories have trade-offs**

   

   #### 2. Interpretive theories

   1. clarification of values

   2. New understanding of people: a personal view

   3. aesthetic appeal: it encourages to be creative, and the use of metaphors/imagery, etc.

   4. community of agreement: The community considered it good

   5. reform of society: the interpretive scholars do their research to make it occur to the society. To make people rethink, respond, and react.

   6. Qualitative research: assessment of words 

      e.g., textual analysis; ethnography

   

   ### What makes good theorie?

   1. they offer insights and new ideas
   2. theories will change constantly - they are the products of elaboration, collaboration, and extension. 
   3. good theories stay power. They remain interesting, and useful, and will not be abandoned easily. 

   

   

   

   ## 2nd Class, Thursday

   #### Seven Traditions in Communication Studies - used as lens

   1. socio-psychological tradition

   2. cybernetic tradition: Communication is a system of information processing

   3. Rhetorical studies: Communication as artful public address

      use public speech to convince the listeners

      - speech/that we can talk, distinguish humans from animals

   4. Symbolic tradition: communication as the process of sharing meaning through signs

      Anything can stand for something else. - depends on the interaction/culture

   5. Socio-cultural tradition: Communication as the creation and enactment of social reality

      We create and recreate the culture by talking. 

      - SATIR WHORS: "Language shapes what people think and what they do."

   6. Critical Traditions: communication as a reflective challenge to unjust discourse

      Critical traditions believe that it's impossible to be objective. 

   7. Phenomenological tradition: Communication as experiences of self and others through dialogue

      Understanding others' stories, and how to grow/sustain relationships.

      

      The map of seven traditions: Some theories can be a mix of two/three traditions, but it's hard to mix traditions that are too different from each other. Like mixing the critical traditions and socio-psychological traditions.
