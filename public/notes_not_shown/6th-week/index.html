<h2 id="1st-class-tuesday-communication-management-privacy">1st Class, Tuesday, Communication Management Privacy</h2>
<p><strong>An interpretive theory in the tradition of socio-cultural</strong></p>
<p>Theorist: Sandra Petronio</p>
<p>She cares about privacy in interpersonal communication, rather than self-disclosure.</p>
<h4 id="1-principle-1-people-believe-that-we-have-privacy-and-we-are-obliged-to-care-for-that-information">1. Principle 1: People believe that we have privacy and we are obliged to care for that information.</h4>
<p>We set boundaries about our own privacy.</p>
<p>For example, in health, we need to close this information, which will impact our life, and we set the boundary, because of the liability.</p>
<h4 id="2-principle-2-people-control-their-private-information-through-the-use-of-personal-privacy-rules">2. Principle 2: People control their private information through the use of personal privacy rules.</h4>
<p>So we understand others&rsquo; privacy through their rules.</p>
<p>The rules could be influenced by:</p>
<ul>
<li>culture</li>
<li>gender: e.g., women were supposed to share more information than men.</li>
<li>motivation</li>
<li>context: context is more influential. Because when you talk to someone, that determines whether or not to talk about privacy.</li>
<li>risk/benefit ratio</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-principle-3-when-others-are-told-or-discover-a-persons-private-information-they-become-co-owners-of-that-information">3. Principle 3: When others are told or discover a person&rsquo;s private information, they become co-owners of that information</h4>
<h4 id="4-principle-4-co-owners-of-private-information-need-to-negotiate-mutually-agreeable-privacy-rules">4. Principle 4: Co-owners of private information need to negotiate mutually agreeable privacy rules</h4>
<p>Boundary ownership - the right and responsibilities that co-owners of private information have to control the spread of that information.</p>
<p>Boundary linkage - the process in which a confidant is linked to the privacy boundary of the person who revealed the information</p>
<p>Boundary permeability - how fluid the boundaries around the private information area</p>
<h4 id="5-principle-5-when-co-owners-of-private-information-dont-effectively-negotiate-and-follow-jointly-held-privacy-rules-boundary-turbulence-is-the-likely-result">5. Principle 5: When co-owners of private information don&rsquo;t effectively negotiate and follow jointly held privacy rules, boundary turbulence is the likely result</h4>
<p>Boundary turbulence: The disruption in the way the co-owners share private information.</p>
<p>The forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuzzy boundaries.</li>
<li>Intentional breaches.</li>
<li>Mistakes</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="6-critiques">6. Critiques</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lacks aesthetic appeal</li>
<li>How boundaries are created - no explanation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-2nd-class-thursday-media-multiplexity-theory">2. 2nd Class, Thursday, Media Multiplexity Theory</h2>
<p><strong>A more objective theory in the cybernetic and socio-psychological tradition</strong></p>
<p>This is a theory that describes strong ties, weak ties, and bridge ties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong ties use more media channels than weak ties, to continue.</li>
<li>Bridging ties allows information to pass to weak ties.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1-tie-strength-is-positively-associated-with-media-multiplexity">1. Tie strength is positively associated with media multiplexity</h4>
<h4 id="2-communication-content-differs-by-strength-not-by-the-medium">2. Communication content differs by strength, not by the medium</h4>
<p>e.g., maybe you share the same content with a kind of tie, even in multiple mediums</p>
<p>Affordances: the medium can enable/constrain certain actions.</p>
<h4 id="3-the-strength-and-media-cause-one-another-over-time">3. The strength and media cause one another over time</h4>
<p>When they come closer, they add more mediums.</p>
<p>And when they add more mediums, they come closer.</p>
<h4 id="4-changes-in-the-media-landscape-particularly-influence-weak-ties">4. Changes in the media landscape particularly influence weak ties</h4>
<p>For strong ties, even if you lose one medium, you still have multiple mediums.</p>
<h4 id="5-groups-have-hierarchies-of-media-use-expectations">5. Groups have hierarchies of media use expectations</h4>
<p>F2F Meeting -&gt; Email -&gt; Social Media -&gt; Text</p>
<p>It depends on the group norm, and social norm.</p>
<h4 id="6-critiques-1">6. Critiques</h4>
<ul>
<li>Chicken and Egg: which comes first? - the relationship and multiple media use</li>
<li>Struggle to predict future events</li>
</ul>
