<h2 id="tuesday-dramatism">Tuesday, Dramatism</h2>
<p><strong>A theory leaning to interpretive, in the tradition of rhetoric.</strong></p>
<p>Rhetorical tradition: Communication as social address.</p>
<p>Key question: Why did people choose the words that they chose? To determine the motivation behind their message.</p>
<p>Could be considered as a theory, but also could be considered as a method.</p>
<p>Theorist: Kenneth Burke</p>
<h4 id="1-dramatism-is-a-technique-of-analysis-of-language-and-thought-as-modes-of-action-rather-than-as-means-of-conveying-information">1. Dramatism is a technique of analysis of language and thought as modes of action rather than as means of conveying information.</h4>
<p>Intentional action + symbolic action = drama</p>
<p>Plan + action = drama</p>
<p>Symbolic action is giving life to the motive behind the message.</p>
<h4 id="2-feature-1-language-is-the-genesis-of-guilt">2. Feature 1: Language is the genesis of guilt.</h4>
<p>Language can lead to the downfall of ourselves – the negative part of ourselves.</p>
<p>It matters because language brings out the negative sides of people – People are inherently good and positive.</p>
<p>“Man is the symbol-using inventor of the negative separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of the hierarchy, and rotten with perfection.”</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Rotten with perfection&rdquo; means that it&rsquo;s never possible to get to the perfection in the redemption of guilt in language.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-feature-2-the-guilt-redemption-cycle-describes-getting-rid-of-guilt-through-purification">3. Feature 2: the guilt-redemption cycle describes getting rid of guilt through purification</h4>
<p>motive could be redeeming themselves from guilt.</p>
<p>Guilt -》purification -》redemption</p>
<p>1）God term vs. devil term</p>
<p>God terms: summing up good.</p>
<p>Devil term: bad and wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a contrast between good and evil.</p>
<p>2）Purification: two ways</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mortification: Taking personal responsibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Victimage: Blaming someone outside</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-identification-is-the-common-ground-between-the-speaker-and-the-audience">3. Identification is the common ground between the speaker and the audience</h4>
<h4 id="4-the-dramatistic-pentad-is-a-tool-critics-can-use-to-discern-the-motives-of-a-speaker-or-writer-by-labeling-five-key-elements-of-the-human-drama">4. The dramatistic pentad is a tool critics can use to discern the motives of a speaker or writer by labeling five key elements of the human drama</h4>
<ul>
<li>Act: What is being done?</li>
<li>Agency: Mean by which an action occurs.</li>
<li>Agent: Person doing the act.</li>
<li>Scene: Setting/Background for action.</li>
<li>Purpose: Reason/Rationale behind the action.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-tuesday-narrative-paradigm">2. Tuesday, Narrative Paradigm</h2>
<p><strong>A theory leaning to interpretive, in the tradition of rhetoric.</strong></p>
<p>All communication other than common words, are considered stories.</p>
<p>Theorist: Walther</p>
<p>Narration: involves symbolic actions that have sequence and meaning for those who live, create, or interpret them.</p>
<h4 id="1-paradigm-a-universal-model-that-calls-for-people-to-view-events-through-a-common-interpretive-lens">1. Paradigm: a universal model that calls for people to view events through a common interpretive lens</h4>
<p>Paradigm shifts from the rational world to the narrative.</p>
<p>Rational-world paradigm: a scientific or philosophical approach to knowledge that assumes people are logical.</p>
<h4 id="2-narrative-rationality-a-way-to-evaluate-the-worth-of-stories">2. Narrative rationality: a way to evaluate the worth of stories.</h4>
<p>Narrative coherence: the story sounds probable.</p>
<p>Narrative fidelity: the story is true and humane.</p>
<h4 id="3-ideal-audience-actual-community-existing-over-time-that-believes-in-the-same-value">3. Ideal audience: actual community existing over time that believes in the same value</h4>
