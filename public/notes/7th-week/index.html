<p><strong>A highly objective theory in the tradition of socio-psychological</strong> (almost the most objective one)</p>
<p>Theorists: Richard Petty &amp; John Cacioppo</p>
<p>Key question: How do you get someone to listen to you when you are making an argument?</p>
<h4 id="1-there-are-two-routes-to-persuasion-the-central-route-and-the-peripheral-route">1. There are two routes to persuasion: the central route and the peripheral route</h4>
<p>Central: high mental effort</p>
<p>Peripheral route: low mental effort</p>
<p>The mental effort is what the listener gives to the speaker</p>
<p>1）The central route is based on elaboration</p>
<p>Elaboration: &ldquo;the extent to which a person carefully thinks about issue-relevant arguments contained in a persuasive communication.&rdquo; (p. 152)</p>
<h4 id="2-elaboration-likelihood-is-based-on-motivation-ability-and-type">2. Elaboration likelihood is based on motivation, ability, and type</h4>
<p>1）Motivation: personal relevance + need for cognition</p>
<p>Personal relevance: the topic is relevant to me.</p>
<p>Need for cognition: You have strong need for cognition on a daily basis.</p>
<p>2）Ability: Free from distraction + Sufficient knowledge</p>
<p>3）Type</p>
<p>Objective + Bias</p>
<p>Based on the speech quality and your initial attitude</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Objective elaboration: bottom-up thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bias elaboration: top-down thinking. You bias attitude is covering from top to bottom, covering everything the speaker is going to say.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-peripheral-route">3. Peripheral Route</h4>
<p>Most of the time we make quick judgements, using the peripheral routes.</p>
<p>Cues for us to use the peripheral route. e.g., they dress well; they look professional; etc.</p>
<p>However, the attitude change is weak/no attitude change.</p>
<p>If you use peripheral route, you might experience attitude change several times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reciprocation. &ldquo;You own me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Consistency. &ldquo;We always use it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Social proof. &ldquo;Everybody is doing it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Liking. You are persuaded by the person, not the message.</li>
<li>Authority. Someone in the authority role, and they are guiding you in the correct direction.</li>
<li>Scarcity. Pressure convince us to buy something. If we don&rsquo;t do it now, we will never do it again.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cues might overlap and happen simultaneously.</p>
<h4 id="4-critique">4. Critique</h4>
<p>difficule to test.</p>
