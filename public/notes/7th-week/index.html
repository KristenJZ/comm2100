<h2 id="elaboration-likelihood-model">Elaboration Likelihood Model</h2>
<p><strong>A highly objective theory in the tradition of socio-psychological</strong> (almost the most objective one)</p>
<p>Theorists: Richard Petty &amp; John Cacioppo</p>
<p>Key question: How do you get someone to listen to you when you are making an argument?</p>
<h4 id="1-there-are-two-routes-to-persuasion-the-central-route-and-the-peripheral-route">1. There are two routes to persuasion: the central route and the peripheral route</h4>
<p>Central: high mental effort</p>
<p>Peripheral route: low mental effort</p>
<p>The mental effort is what the listener gives to the speaker</p>
<p>1）The central route is based on elaboration</p>
<p>Elaboration: &ldquo;the extent to which a person carefully thinks about issue-relevant arguments contained in a persuasive communication.&rdquo; (p. 152)</p>
<h4 id="2-elaboration-likelihood-is-based-on-motivation-ability-and-type">2. Elaboration likelihood is based on motivation, ability, and type</h4>
<p>1）Motivation: personal relevance + need for cognition</p>
<p>Personal relevance: the topic is relevant to me.</p>
<p>Need for cognition: You have strong need for cognition on a daily basis.</p>
<p>2）Ability: Free from distraction + Sufficient knowledge</p>
<p>3）Type</p>
<p>Objective + Bias</p>
<p>Based on the speech quality and your initial attitude</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Objective elaboration: bottom-up thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bias elaboration: top-down thinking. You bias attitude is covering from top to bottom, covering everything the speaker is going to say.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-outcomes">3. Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
<li>favorable case</li>
<li>unfavorable case</li>
<li>neutral case</li>
<li>Only central path cause strong attitude change, but peripheral route causes weak/no attitude change.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-peripheral-route">4. Peripheral Route</h4>
<p>Most of the time we make quick judgements, using the peripheral routes.</p>
<p>Cues for us to use the peripheral route. e.g., they dress well; they look professional; etc.</p>
<p>However, the attitude change is weak/no attitude change.</p>
<p>If you use peripheral route, you might experience attitude change several times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reciprocation. &ldquo;You owe me.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Consistency. &ldquo;We always use it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Social proof. &ldquo;Everybody is doing it.&rdquo; （kind of peer pressure)</li>
<li>Liking. You are persuaded by the person, not the message. “You love me, and you love my ideas.&quot;</li>
<li>Authority. Someone in the authority role, and they are guiding you in the correct direction.</li>
<li>Scarcity. Pressure convince us to buy something. If we don&rsquo;t do it now, we will never do it again.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cues might overlap and happen simultaneously.</p>
<h4 id="5-critique">5. Critique</h4>
<p>difficule to test.</p>
<h2 id="cognitive-dissonance-theory">Cognitive Dissonance Theory</h2>
<p><strong>A highly objective theory in the tradition of socio-psychological</strong></p>
<p>In the section on social influence/persuasion</p>
<p>Theorist: Leon Festinger</p>
<p>Interested in the dissonance between what people know and what people do.</p>
<p>Assumption: People will do everything to reduce dissonance, for the reason of safety.</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive Dissonance: A distressing mental state caused by inconsistency between a person and the person&rsquo;s beliefs, or a belief and an action.</strong></p>
<p>We have a human need to avoid this distress. Therefore, we accept one or reject the other (whichever is easier).</p>
<p>e.g., the sour grape – if the fox cannot have the grape on the tree, he will believe that it&rsquo;s sour. It&rsquo;s unable to change the action (to get the grape), so he changes his belief.</p>
<h4 id="1-mental-mechanisms-to-ensure-their-actions--attitudes-are-in-harmony">1. Mental Mechanisms to ensure their actions &amp; attitudes are in harmony</h4>
<p>1）Selective exposure prevents dissonance.</p>
<p>We avoid any information that may go against the action.</p>
<p>2）Post-decision dissonance creates a need for reassurance</p>
<p>This usually happens when people make a close-minded decision.</p>
<p>e.g., People read the reviews after they purchase some items. The more life-changing decisions there will be, the more dissonance there will be, so there will be more need for seeking reassurance.</p>
<p>3）Minimal justification for action induces attitude change</p>
<p>Minimal Justification: Minimal incentive will provide longer change.</p>
<p>Minimal justification: too much justification won&rsquo;t have a long-standing attitude change. Just enough to change the attitude. When you offer someone too much justification, they will be sensitive, but not change their attitudes.</p>
<p>Experiment: Would I lie for a dollar?</p>
<h4 id="2-major-revisions-to-cdt">2. Major revisions to CDT</h4>
<ul>
<li>Self-consistency: Our actions should be consistent with who we believe we are. If you want to persuade others not to smoke, you&rsquo;d choose to tell them that smoking is not their style.</li>
<li>Personal responsibility for bad outcomes: People experience dissonance when their actions have unnecessarily hurt someone. People are afraid that their behaviors will affect their children, and they will change their behavior.</li>
<li>Self-affirmation: dissonance drive people to justify their actions by changing their attitudes.</li>
</ul>
