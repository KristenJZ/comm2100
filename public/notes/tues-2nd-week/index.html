<h3 id="review-the-scale-from-objective-to-interpretive">Review: the scale from objective to interpretive</h3>
<p>Interpretive scholars: put all the experiences (from them/the participants) to create meaning and multiple realities</p>
<p>Objective scholars: put the theory out of the maths/models</p>
<h3 id="different-standards">Different standards</h3>
<h4 id="1-objective-theories-scientific-standards">1. Objective theories: scientific standards</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>prediction of future events: Will people repeat the same behaviors?</p>
<p>Sometimes human behaviors cannot be predictable. But most of the times, it will predict very well.</p>
<p><em>How to define the prediction: the confidence interval in quantitative research - 95%</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explanation of the data</p>
<p>To be able to predict, you need to be able to explain the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relative simplicity</p>
<p>occam&rsquo;s razor: two ways, you choose the simpler one.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s simple, but it can involve complex understandings.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hypotheses that can be tested</p>
<p>Scientific theories should be able to proved wrong. （only a possibility of being true)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>practical utility</p>
<p>The theories will be used in different contexts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quantitative research: care for statistics and data - A causes B</p>
<p>e.g., survey (the collection of self-reported data); experiment</p>
<p><strong>The standards cannot be met all the time: theories have trade-offs</strong></p>
<h4 id="2-interpretive-theories">2. Interpretive theories</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>clarification of values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New understanding of people: a personal view</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aesthetic appeal: it encourages to be creative, and the use of metaphors/imagery, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>community of agreement: The community considered it good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reform of society: the interpretive scholars do their research to make it occur to the society. To make people rethink, respond, and react.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qualitative research: assessment of words</p>
<p>e.g., textual analysis; ethnography</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-makes-good-theorie">What makes good theorie?</h3>
<ol>
<li>they offer insights and new ideas</li>
<li>theories will change constantly - they are the products of elaboration, collaboration, and extension.</li>
<li>good theories stay power. They remain interesting, and useful, and will not be abandoned easily.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2nd-class-thursday">2nd Class, Thursday</h2>
<h4 id="seven-traditions-in-communication-studies---used-as-lens">Seven Traditions in Communication Studies - used as lens</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>socio-psychological tradition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cybernetic tradition: Communication is a system of information processing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rhetorical studies: Communication as artful public address</p>
<p>use public speech to convince the listeners</p>
<ul>
<li>speech/that we can talk, distinguish humans from animals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Symbolic tradition: communication as the process of sharing meaning through signs</p>
<p>Anything can stand for something else. - depends on the interaction/culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Socio-cultural tradition: Communication as the creation and enactment of social reality</p>
<p>We create and recreate the culture by talking.</p>
<ul>
<li>SATIR WHORS: &ldquo;Language shapes what people think and what they do.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical Traditions: communication as a reflective challenge to unjust discourse</p>
<p>Critical traditions believe that it&rsquo;s impossible to be objective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phenomenological tradition: Communication as experiences of self and others through dialogue</p>
<p>Understanding others&rsquo; stories, and how to grow/sustain relationships.</p>
<p>The map of seven traditions: Some theories can be a mix of two/three traditions, but it&rsquo;s hard to mix traditions that are too different from each other. Like mixing the critical traditions and socio-psychological traditions.</p>
