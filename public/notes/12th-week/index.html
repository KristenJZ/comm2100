<h2 id="tuesday-communication-accommodation-theory">Tuesday, Communication Accommodation Theory</h2>
<p>A highly objective theory in the tradition of socio-psychological.</p>
<p>Theorist: Howard Giles</p>
<p>Assumption: While we talk with someone from a different background, we aim to achieve mutual understanding. So we accommodate the conversation to understand each other.</p>
<p>Accommodation: Movement toward or away from others by changing your communication behavior.</p>
<p>e.g., different places; different generations;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a about &ldquo;Social Distance&rdquo;: How similar or different we are from one another.</p>
<h4 id="1-strategies-for-communication-accommodation">1. Strategies for communication accommodation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Convergence: Adapting communication to become more smilar to another person.</li>
<li>The hardest one.</li>
<li>Happen less commonly. But happen more in a closer relationship.</li>
<li>e.g., Discourse management: Choose appropriate topics, you choose to talk about in your conversation - You&rsquo;re managing the discourse.</li>
<li>Divergence: Accentuating the differences between you and another person.
<ul>
<li>Usually, divergence happens more. Because we tend to do what we are comfortable with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maintainance: persisting in your original communication style.</li>
<li>Counteraccommodation: Excessive concern for vocal clarity or amplification.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-the-core-of-cat-out-communicative-differences-and-similarities-are-deeply-intertwined-with-our-group-identities">2. The core of CAT: Out communicative differences and similarities are deeply intertwined with our group identities</h4>
<p>Personal Identity &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;  Social Identity</p>
<p>Personal Identity: Characteristics that make an individual unique and autonomous.</p>
<p>Social (group) identity: Characteristics or categories that define us a part of a large socail group (e.g., ethnicity)</p>
<p>Identity Saliance: Likelihood a given identity will be active across contexts; based on the idea that identities get ranked in a hierarchy and higher ranked identities are more likely to be emphasized or enacted</p>
<h4 id="3-different-motivations-for-convergence-and-divergence">3. Different Motivations for Convergence and Divergence</h4>
<p>Desire for Approval (Personal Identity) -&gt; Convergence -&gt; Positive Response</p>
<p>Need for Distinctiveness (Social Identity) -&gt; Divergence - &gt; Negative Response</p>
<h4 id="4-initial-orientation-predict-whether-their-concerns-for-personal-identity-or-social-identity-will-be-salient">4. Initial Orientation: Predict whether their concerns for personal identity or social identity will be salient.</h4>
<p>The following five will make people rely on social identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Collectivistic cultural context (we-centered)</li>
<li>Distressing history of interaction.</li>
<li>Steoreotypes</li>
<li>Norms for treatment of group.</li>
<li>High group-solidarity/group dependence.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="face-negotiation-theory">Face Negotiation Theory</h2>
<p>A highly objective theory in the tradition of socio-psychological tradition</p>
<p>Theorist: Stella Ting-Toomey</p>
<p>Cultural differences conflict.</p>
<ul>
<li>Face: the projected self-image of oneself in a relational situation, or our public self-image.</li>
<li>Facework: specific verbal and nonverbal messages that help to maintain and restore face loss, and to uphold and honor face gain.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1-type-of-culture-collectivistic--individualistic-cultures-can-be-distinguished-by-perceptions-of-self-goals-and-duty">1. Type of culture: Collectivistic &amp; Individualistic Cultures can be distinguished by perceptions of self, goals, and duty.</h4>
<p>Individualistic: I-centered.</p>
<p>Collectivistic: We-centered.</p>
