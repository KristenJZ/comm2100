<h2 id="1st-class-tuesday-symbolic-interactionism-theory">1st Class, Tuesday, Symbolic Interactionism Theory</h2>
<p><strong>A highly interpretive theory in the socio-cultural tradition.</strong></p>
<p>Theorist: George Herbert Mead</p>
<p>（He didn&rsquo;t write the book. His students recorded his minds in the book <em>Mind, Self and Society</em></p>
<h4 id="1-principles">1. Principles</h4>
<p>1）Principle #1: Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meaning they assign to them.</p>
<p>stimulus -&gt; interpretation -&gt; response</p>
<ul>
<li>When we do verbal/non-verbal communication, we have guessings about what will be the response.</li>
<li>Human reactions towards stimuli are based on the meaning assigned to them.</li>
<li>Interpretation counts: A fact is a fact, but what it means to us is different.  Acting based on the interpretation.</li>
<li><em>e.g., I hear people cry, and I assign meaning to that, and I assume that they are sad. I give him/her a hug.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>2）Principle #2: Meaning arises out of the social interaction that people have with each other.</p>
<p>The object is meaningless until we assign meaning.</p>
<p><strong>naming: the central aspect of the principle</strong>: As humans, we have the ability to name things. The ability sets humans apart from animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>The more names you know, the more knowledge you will know.</li>
<li>We all have assumptions about these names.</li>
<li>Society determines the meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>3）Principle #3: An individual&rsquo;s interpretation of symbols is modified by their own thought process. (<strong>minding process</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Minding: The moment of reflective pause.</strong> We take a moment a think through what we are experiencing.</p>
<h4 id="2-looking-glass-self">2. Looking glass self</h4>
<p>Looking glass self: We learn who we are (the self) through our socially constructed ideas about how others see us.</p>
<p><strong>We know who we are through interaction and introspection.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What others believe about us.
<ul>
<li>For, If you say lots of negative things about children, they will see themselves in that way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Understanding ourselves based on our interaction with others.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;self&rdquo; concept will always change because of the different interactions with others.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;I&rdquo; vs &ldquo;me&rdquo;:</strong>
<ul>
<li>I: subjective, unpredictable, and even chaotic parts of ourselves.</li>
<li>me: objective, the thing you understand about yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
