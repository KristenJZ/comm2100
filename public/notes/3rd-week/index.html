<h2 id="symbolic-interactionism-theory">Symbolic Interactionism Theory</h2>
<p><strong>A highly interpretive theory in the socio-cultural tradition.</strong> - people produce and reproduce culture in communication.</p>
<p>Theorist: George Herbert Mead</p>
<p>（He didn&rsquo;t write the book. His students recorded his minds in the book <em>Mind, Self and Society</em></p>
<h4 id="1-principles">1. Principles</h4>
<p>1）Principle #1: Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meaning they assign to them.</p>
<p>stimulus -&gt; interpretation -&gt; response</p>
<ul>
<li>When we do verbal/non-verbal communication, we have guessings about what will be the response.</li>
<li>Human reactions towards stimuli are based on the meaning assigned to them.</li>
<li>Interpretation counts: A fact is a fact, but what it means to us is different.  Acting based on the interpretation.</li>
<li><em>e.g., I hear people cry, and I assign meaning to that, and I assume that they are sad. I give him/her a hug.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>2）Principle #2: Meaning arises out of the social interaction that people have with each other.</p>
<p>The object is meaningless until we assign meaning.</p>
<p><strong>naming: the central aspect of the principle</strong>: As humans, we have the ability to name things. The ability sets humans apart from animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>The more names you know, the more knowledge you will know.</li>
<li>We all have assumptions about these names.</li>
<li>Society determines the meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>3）Principle #3: An individual&rsquo;s interpretation of symbols is modified by their own thought process. (<strong>minding process</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Minding: The moment of reflective pause.</strong> We take a moment a think through what we are experiencing.</p>
<h4 id="2-looking-glass-self">2. Looking glass self</h4>
<p>Looking glass self: We learn who we are (the self) through our socially constructed ideas about how others see us.</p>
<p><strong>We know who we are through interaction and introspection.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What others believe about us.
<ul>
<li>For, If you say lots of negative things about children, they will see themselves in that way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Understanding ourselves based on our interaction with others.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;self&rdquo; concept will always change because of the different interactions with others.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;I&rdquo; vs &ldquo;me&rdquo;:</strong>
<ul>
<li>I: subjective, unpredictable, and even chaotic parts of ourselves.</li>
<li>me: Objective, the thing you understand about yourself.</li>
<li><strong>The moment you become aware of yourself, it moves from I to me.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The real you: I.</li>
<li>The reflection: me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-society---the-generalized-other">3. Society - the generalized other</h4>
<p>The generalized other: the composite mental image of others in an overall community, their expectations, and possible responses.</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s why trends become trends.</li>
<li>The more people in your generalized other, the harder to keep to society&rsquo;s expectations.</li>
<li>The more people around you, the more you become aware of yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-applications">4. Applications</h4>
<p>1）Application for #1: The generalized other teaches us who &ldquo;me&rdquo; is in both positive and negative ways.</p>
<p>2）Application for #2: self-fulfillling pophecy - the tendency for our expectations to evoke responses that confirm what we anticipated.</p>
<p>our actions -&gt; others belief -&gt; others actions -&gt; our beliefs</p>
<h4 id="5-critiques">5. Critiques</h4>
<ul>
<li>does not calll for societal reform.</li>
<li>lacks aeshetic appeal: no organized design - not very simplistic.</li>
<li>Mead overstates his case.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="expectancy-violations-theory">Expectancy Violations Theory</h2>
<p><strong>A highly objective theory in interpersonal communication, in socio-psychological tradition</strong></p>
<p>Theorist: Judee Burgoon</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s interested in non-verbal communication and personal space.</p>
<h4 id="1-personal-space-the-invisible-variable-volume-of-space-surrounding-an-individual-that-defines-their-preferred-distance-from-others">1. Personal space: the invisible, variable volume of space surrounding an individual that defines their preferred distance from others.</h4>
<p>most people will be put in the social space (1.2m - 3.7m)</p>
<h4 id="2-core-concept">2. Core concept</h4>
<p>1）Expectancy: what is predicted to occur rather than what is desired.</p>
<p>It depends on what is expected.</p>
<ul>
<li>context: rely on cultural norms.
<ul>
<li>Where is the interaction taking place and playing a role in the way you hope the interaction to  go?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>relationship factors:
<ul>
<li>similarity, familarity, and like</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>communicator charatertistics: demographic factors, personal features, and how they communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>2）Violation valence: the positive/negative value we place on an expected behavior.</p>
<p>3）Communication reward valence: the sum of positive and negative attributes that the person has plu their potential to reward or punish.</p>
<h4 id="3-critique">3. Critique</h4>
<ul>
<li>Does not account reciprocity.</li>
<li>Is comm. valence or behavior valence more important?</li>
</ul>
