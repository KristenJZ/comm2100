<h2 id="1st-class-tuesday-cognitive-dissonance-theory">1st Class, Tuesday, Cognitive Dissonance Theory</h2>
<p><strong>A highly objective theory in the tradition of socio-psychological</strong></p>
<p>In the section on social influence/persuasion</p>
<p>Theorist: Leon Festinger</p>
<p>Interested in the dissonance between what people know and what people do.</p>
<p>Assumption: People will do everything to reduce dissonance, for the reason of safety.</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive Dissonance: A distressing mental state caused by inconsistency between a person and the person&rsquo;s beliefs, or a belief and an action.</strong></p>
<p>We have a human need to avoid this distress. Therefore, we accept one or reject the other (whichever is easier).</p>
<p>e.g., the sour grape – if the fox cannot have the grape on the tree, he will believe that it&rsquo;s sour. It&rsquo;s unable to change the action (to get the grape), so he changes his belief.</p>
<h4 id="1-mental-mechanisms-to-ensure-their-actions--attitudes-are-in-harmony">1. Mental Mechanisms to ensure their actions &amp; attitudes are in harmony</h4>
<p>1）Selective exposure prevents dissonance.</p>
<p>We avoid any information that may go against the action.</p>
<p>2）Post-decision dissonance creates a need for reassurance</p>
<p>This usually happens when people make a close-minded decision.</p>
<p>e.g., People read the reviews after they purchase some items. The more life-changing decisions there will be, the more dissonance there will be, so there will be more need for seeking reassurance.</p>
<p>3）Minimal justification for action induces attitude change</p>
<p>Minimal Justification: Minimal incentive will provide longer change.</p>
<p>Minimal justification: too much justification won&rsquo;t have a long-standing attitude change. Just enough to change the attitude. When you offer someone too much justification, they will be sensitive, but not change their attitudes.</p>
<p>Experiment: Would I lie for a dollar?</p>
<h4 id="2-major-revisions-to-cdt">2. Major revisions to CDT</h4>
<ul>
<li>Self-consistency: Our actions should be consistent with who we believe we are. If you want to persuade others not to smoke, you&rsquo;d choose to tell them that smoking is not their style.</li>
<li>Personal responsibility for bad outcomes: People experience dissonance when their actions have unnecessarily hurt someone. People are afraid that their behaviors will affect their children, and they will change their behavior.</li>
<li>Self-affirmation</li>
</ul>
