<h2 id="rhetoric">Rhetoric</h2>
<p>In the tradition of rhetoric.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s half objective and half interpretive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about arts, and also about persuasion.</p>
<p>Theorist: Aristotle.</p>
<h4 id="1-rhetoric-discovering-all-possible-means-of-persuasion">1. Rhetoric: discovering all possible means of persuasion.</h4>
<p>Three different categories:</p>
<p>Forensic: emphasizes that people make decisions about past actions. For example, the scenario of a court is a place for forensics.</p>
<p>Epideictic: offer to pray/blame, to benefit a president day&rsquo;s audience/situation.</p>
<p>Deliberative: political speaking. Generally, a deliberative speech is designed to influence votes, for a future policy/person in power.</p>
<h4 id="2-social-proofs-from-internal-artistic-to-external-inartistic">2. Social Proofs from internal (artistic) to external (inartistic)</h4>
<p>Internal proofs: what we can control in the speech</p>
<p>Audience is external proof, which we cannot control.</p>
<p>1）heart (pathos)</p>
<p>the emotional proof, which comes from the feelings the speech draws out of those who hear it.</p>
<p>2）head (logos)</p>
<p>the logical proof, which comes from the line of argument in a speech.</p>
<p>A classic logos: enthymeme (a type of reasoning that leaves out an accepted premise)</p>
<ul>
<li>Deductive thinking: from premise (major-minor) to conclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another form of logos: example.</p>
<p>3）credibility (ethos)</p>
<p>the perceived credibility as it is revealed through the message.</p>
<p>Three components to credibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>perceived intelligence: practical wisdom.</li>
<li>virtuous character.</li>
<li>goodwill: do they have the best of the audiences&rsquo; interest in heart?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-five-canons-of-rhetoric-used-for-measuring-the-quality-of-a-speaker">3. Five Canons of rhetoric used for measuring the quality of a speaker</h4>
<ul>
<li>Invention: adjust when necessary.</li>
<li>Arrangement: the organization of the speech. Should be simple, direct, and highly relevant to your topic.</li>
<li>Style: how the speaker presents the speech. The metaphor is a powerful mechanism we can use to deliver speech.</li>
<li>Delivery: be natural.</li>
<li>Memory: memorize, but not plan. Also calling back to those things to stock the audiences&rsquo; memory.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-critiques">4. Critiques</h4>
<ul>
<li>Violations of the standard of relative simplicity.</li>
<li>Original presentation of ideas backs aesthetic appeal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dramatism">Dramatism</h2>
<p><strong>A theory leaning to interpretive, in the tradition of rhetoric.</strong></p>
<p>Rhetorical tradition: Communication as social address.</p>
<p>Key question: Why did people choose the words that they chose? To determine the motivation behind their message.</p>
<p><strong>Could be considered as a theory, but also could be considered as a method.</strong></p>
<p>Theorist: Kenneth Burke</p>
<h4 id="1-dramatism-is-a-technique-of-analysis-of-language-and-thought-as-modes-of-action-rather-than-as-means-of-conveying-information">1. Dramatism is a technique of analysis of language and thought as modes of action rather than as means of conveying information.</h4>
<p>Intentional action + symbolic action = drama</p>
<p>Plan + action = drama</p>
<p>Symbolic action is giving life to the motive behind the message.</p>
<h4 id="2-feature-1-language-is-the-genesis-of-guilt">2. Feature 1: Language is the genesis of guilt.</h4>
<p>Language can lead to the downfall of ourselves – the negative part of ourselves.</p>
<p>It matters because language brings out the negative sides of people – People are inherently good and positive.</p>
<p>“Man is the symbol-using inventor of the negative separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of the hierarchy, and rotten with perfection.”</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Rotten with perfection&rdquo; means that it&rsquo;s never possible to get to the perfection in the redemption of guilt in language.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-feature-2-the-guilt-redemption-cycle-describes-getting-rid-of-guilt-through-purification">3. Feature 2: the guilt-redemption cycle describes getting rid of guilt through purification</h4>
<p>motive could be redeeming themselves from guilt.</p>
<p>Guilt -》purification -》redemption</p>
<p>1）God term vs. devil term</p>
<p>God terms: summing up good.</p>
<p>Devil term: bad and wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a contrast between good and evil.</p>
<p>2）Purification: two ways</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mortification: Taking personal responsibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Victimage: Blaming someone outside</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-identification-is-the-common-ground-between-the-speaker-and-the-audience">3. Identification is the common ground between the speaker and the audience</h4>
<h4 id="4-the-dramatistic-pentad-is-a-tool-critics-can-use-to-discern-the-motives-of-a-speaker-or-writer-by-labeling-five-key-elements-of-the-human-drama">4. The dramatistic pentad is a tool critics can use to discern the motives of a speaker or writer by labeling five key elements of the human drama</h4>
<ul>
<li>Act: What is being done?</li>
<li>Agency: Mean by which an action occurs.</li>
<li>Agent: Person doing the act.</li>
<li>Scene: Setting/Background for action.</li>
<li>Purpose: Reason/Rationale behind the action.</li>
</ul>
